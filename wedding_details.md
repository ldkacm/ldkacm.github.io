Our wedding will take place during the 
[Las Vegas Rock N Roll Half Marathon](http://www.runrocknroll.com/las-vegas/)
on November 12, 2017.
We invite all of our friends and family to participate in the half marathon 
with us. The wedding takes place at mile 3 of the race, so you can join us for 
the first 3 miles or the entire half marathon. Once we know the exact location
of the wedding we will provide details so all of you can join us.

The half marathon starts at 5:30 and we anticipate being done with the run by 
8pm. We are having a dessert reception at the 
[Springs Preserve](https://www.springspreserve.org) in the Patio and 
Garden Terrace. We will have light snacks, drinks, and desserts for you to 
enjoy.

In addition, if any of our guests will be available the next morning we are 
planning to treat our guests to the brunch at the Wynn Buffet.
